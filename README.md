# LeftWM Contrib

This repository is a collection of basic example configurations (formerly in the leftwm repos `theme` folder), patches contributed by the community that didn't get merged in leftwm-main branch and a home to other leftwm related contributions that didn't fit well within the core repository.

#### Contributing
Contributions of any kind are welcome at any time, please just follow these very basic guides to keep a minimum of consitency:
- add your own subfolder (please use a meaningful name) in either category `examples` or `patches` (more might follow if the need arises)
- your submission should contain its own little README
- add your submission to the list in the main README

### Examples
- basic_eww
- basic_lemonbar
- basic_polybar
- basic_xmobar
- config_ron
- controlling_leftwm

### Patches
[[ Still a little empty here...]]
